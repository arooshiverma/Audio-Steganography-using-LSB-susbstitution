Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted.

The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.

In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression.

It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.)

From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest.

This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing".

Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other.

This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication.

This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place.

These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes).

Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in.

Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today.

The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1].

Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves.

Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique.

It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time.

From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest.

This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing".

Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other.

This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication.

This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place.

These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes).

Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in.

Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today.

The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1].

Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves.

Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique.

It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time.

From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest.

This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing".

Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.Steganography comes from the Greek and literally means,"Covered writing". It is one of various data hiding techniques, which aims at transmitting a message on a channel where some other kind of information is already being transmitted. This distinguishes steganography from covert channel techniques, which instead of trying to transmit data between two entities that were unconnected before. Steganography is defined by Markus Kahn as follows, "Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity"[1]. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message present".The only missing information for the "enemy" is the short easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key, without the secret key, the "enemy" should not have the slightest chance of even becoming suspicious that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication might take place.Steganography is closely related to the problem of "hidden channels" n secure operating system design, a term which refers to all communication paths that cannot easily be restricted by access control mechanisms. In an ideal world we would all be able to sent openly encrypted mail or files to each other with no fear of reprisals. However there are often cases when this is possible, either because the working company does not allow encrypted email or the local government does not approve of encrypt communication (a reality in some parts of the world). This is where steganography can come into play.Steganography has developed a lot in recent years, because digital techniques allow new ways of hiding informations inside other informations, and this can be valuable in a lot of situations. The first to employ hidden communications techniques -with radio transmissions- were the armies, because of the strategic importance of secure communication and the need to conceal the source as much as possible.Nowadays, new constraints in using strong encryption for messages are added by international laws, so if two peers want to use it, they can resort in hiding the communication into casual looking data. This problem has become more and more important just in these days, after the international Wassenaar agreement, with which around thirty of the major - with respect to technology - countries in the world decided to apply restrictions in cryptography export similar to the US's ones.In a digital world, Steganography and Cryptography are both intended to protect information from unwanted parties. Both Steganography and Cryptography are excellent means by which to accomplish this but neither technology alone is perfect and both can be broken. It is for this reason that most experts would suggest using both to add multiple layers of security. Steganography can be used in a large amount of data formats in the digital world of today. The most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, .gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because of their popularity on the Internet and the ease of use of the steganographic tools that use these data formats. These formats are also popular because of the relative ease by which redundant or noisy data can be removed from them and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important part of the future of Internet security and privacy on open systems such as the Internet. Steganographic research is primarily driven by the lack of strength in the cryptographic systems on their own and the desire to have complete secrecy in an open-systems environment. Many governments have created laws that either limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit them completely. This has been done primarily for fear by law enforcement not to be able to gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This unfortunately leaves the majority of the Internet community either with relatively weak and a lot of the times breakable encryption algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties advocates fight this with the argument that "these limitations are an assault on privacy". This is where Steganography comes in. Steganography can be used to hide important data inside another file so that only the parties intended to get the message even knows a secret message exists.The earliest recordings of Steganography were by the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles known as "Histories" and date back to around 440 BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of Steganographic techniques during this time in Greece[2]. The first stated that King Darius of Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the prisoner's hair grew back, he was sent to the Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus undetected. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was text written on wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected.Romans used invisible inks, which were based on natural substances such as fruit juices and milk. This was accomplished by heating the hidden text, thus revealing its contents. Invisible inks have become much more advanced and are still in limited use today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers including Johannes Trithemius (author of Steganographia) and Gaspari Schotti (author or Steganographica) wrote on Steganagraphic techniques such as coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and incorporating hidden messages in music.Between 1883 and 1907, further development can be attributed to the publications of Auguste Kerckhoff (author of Cryptographic Militaire) and Charles Briquet (author of Les Filigranes). These books were mostly about Cryptography, but both can be attributed to the foundation of some steganographic systems and more significantly to watermarking techniques.Concepts such as null ciphers (taking the 3rd letter from each word in a harmless message to create a hidden message, etc), image substitution and microdot (taking data such as pictures and reducing it to the size of a large period on a piece of paper) were introduced and embraced as great steganographic techniques.In the recent digital world of today, namely 1992 to present, Steganography is being used all over the world on computer systems. Many tools and technologies have been created that take advantage of old steganographic techniques such as null ciphers, coding in images, audio, video and microdot. With the research this topic is now getting we will see a lot of great applications for Steganography in the near future.Often, although it is not necessary, the hidden messages will be encrypted. This meets a requirement posed by the "Kerckhoff principle" in cryptography. This principle states that the security of the system has to be based on the assumption that the enemy has full knowledge of the design and implementation details of the steganographic system. The only missing information for the enemy is a short, easily exchangeable random number sequence, the secret key. Without this secret key, the enemy should not have the chance to even suspect that on an observed communication channel, hidden communication is taking place. When embedding data it is important to remember the following restrictions and features:The cover data should not be significantly degraded by the embedded data, and theembedded data should be a imperceptible as possible.The embedded data should be directly encoded into the media, rather than into aheader or wrapper, to maintain data consistency across formats.The embedded data should be as immune as possible to modifications from intelligent attacks or anticipated manipulations such as filtering and resampling.Some distortion or degradation of the embedded data can be expected when the cover data is modified. To minimize this, error correcting codes should be used.The embedded data should be self clocking or arbitrarily re-entrant. This ensures that the embedded data can still be extracted when only portions of the cover data is available.Steganography works has been carried out on different transmission mediums like text, audio, video, images.Codes have been around for centuries ranging from wax, invisible ink, Morse code, the Enigma used by the Germans during World War II and now steganographic. Steganography is the latest form to insidiously hide information over the Internet without a trace of a file being altered. You are able to hide messages within images, voice or music. Steganography is an ancient method of hiding messages. Today messages are hidden in images and music. Steganography can be traced back to the ancient Greek who would write messages on tablets and cover them in wax. This made the tablets look blank and unsuspicious (Kolata, F4). Citizens of ancient civilizations would tattoo messages on their shaved heads. They would then let their hair grown in and travel across enemy lines to deliver the message (Seper, G1). During World War II the Allies placed a ban on flower deliveries with dates, crossword puzzles and even report cards (Kolata, F4) for fear of a message being hidden with in. Steganographers first alter their data by using encryption and then place the image into a pre-select image. Steganographers look for a piece of code that would be the least significant and look the least altered to the human eye (Kolata, F4), being as inconspicuousness and random as possible. This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other.

This makes the messages undetectable unless you knew that there is a message hidden and you were able to crack the code.Internet is the Backbone of Modern Communication. Whenever we need to transfer information from one place to another we use Internet. It has been used by almost every organization whether it is corporate or government worldwide. Since internet has been accepted worldwide for communication, security of transfer of information over Internet is one of the major issues of Internet Communication. Because information travels through internet it can be detected and/or attacked by Hackers or anyone who doesn't have the provision of getting access to it. A solution to this problem could be a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. A technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it is not visible. A technique that could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information is Steganography. In the proposed paper we will explain in brief what steganography is, how it is helpful in information hiding, its importance, comparison of steganography with cryptography and techniques to implement steganography.Internet has been one of the most revolutionary developments. The rise of internet has introduced a new era of communication and it opens many doors for efficient and fast communication where people across the globe can communicate and share information with each other. As an individual we all use internet as well as various organizations whether they are corporate or government, schools, research facilities and college and libraries in more than Hundred Countries uses internet. Since internet is now being used worldwide it opens new doors for communication and it changes the whole face of communication and now millions or I should say billions of people across the globe are using internet for various purposes. Whatever being the purpose the backbone of internet is transfer of information from one place to other. So the most important aspect of making information travel on internet is to transfer it in such a manner that it cannot be accessed and/or modified by anyone other than the person for whom the message is being initiated. A solution to this problem is steganography in which we uses a technique by the existence of message is unknown to attackers means other than the intended receiver does not even know about the existence of message. Since tey don't know about the existence they won't be able to attack it. This approach of data hiding is known as Steganography.Steganography is the art and science or an technique by which we can hide the information in such a manner that other than the sender and receiver no one knows about the existence of the message of information being transferred. Steganography helps in maintain the integrity of message as well prevent the message from malicious attack or unauthorized access/modification. Hence ensures securely delivery of message over the internet.Steganography includes methods that can be used to hide message so that it could prevent the messages from being maliciously attacked by intruders. The goal is to hide the existence of messages over the internet and it uses the concept of data hiding. This concept of information hiding is now being used in variety of areas such as audio files, videos files and image files this kind of files are now a day's come with a digital signature kind of a thing which is hidden yet distinguishable which can contain or represent a copyright notice or a serial number etc.The word steganography is derived from the Greek words "stegos" meaning "cover" and "grafia" meaning "writing" [1] defining it as "covered writing". Steganography is a technique that can help in maintaining the secrecy of message being transferred. It is a technique that can hide the information well in such a manner that it could prevent it from malicious attack in addition helpful in maintaining the secrecy of information. Steganography uses the approach where we are hiding the information in such a manner that the intruder will never know that this hidden information ever exists or not. Before Steganography comes into the existence there was a technique called Cryptography how is it different from Steganography we will discuss it further. The topic of Steganography becomes the topic of interest and its growth was started for two main reasons[2]:-The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products.Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.This interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with every new discovery I made. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold.We have witnessed and participated in great advances, in transportation, in computation, in communication, and in biotechnology. But the advances that look like giant steps to us will pale into insignificance by contrast with the even bigger steps in the future. Sometimes I try to imagine what we, the technologists of the second half of the 20th century, will be remembered for, if anything, hundreds of years from now.In the distant past there were people who lived on the banks of the Nile River. Each year the Nile overflowed its banks, wiping out land boundaries but providing fertile soil for growing crops. As a matter of economic necessity the Egyptians invented ways of surveying the land. They also invented ways of measuring time, to help predict the yearly deluge. Similar discoveries were made in many places in the world. Holders of this practical knowledge were held in high esteem, and the knowledge was transferred to future generations through secret cults. These early surveyors laid the foundation for the development of geometry ("earth measurement" in Greek) by Pythagoras and Euclid and their colleagues around 350 BC. Geometry is a precise language for talking about space. It can be taught to children. (Euclid's Elements has been used in this way for more than 2000 years.) It makes the children smarter, by giving them ways of expressing knowledge about arrangements in space and time. It is because of these Greeks that we can tell a child, "If you build it out of triangles it will not collapse the way it does when you build it out of rectangles."The Rhind Papyrus from Egypt (c. 1650 BC) is the earliest document that we have that discusses what we now think of as algebra problems. Diophantus, another Greek, wrote a book about these ideas in the third century A.D. Algebra was further developed by Abu Abd-Allah ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) and others. (Note: "algebra" = al'jabr is an Arabic word meaning "the recombining of broken parts.") Algebra is also a precise language that gives us the ability to express knowledge about the relationships among quantities, and to make deductions from that knowledge, without necessarily knowing the values of those quantities.For a long time people were able to predict the motions of some of the heavenly bodies using ad hoc theories derived from observation and philosophical considerations. Claudius Ptolemy wrote the Almagest, a famous compendium of this knowledge, in the second century. About 350 years ago Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Leibnitz, Euler, and their contemporaries turned mechanics into a formal science. In the process they nvented continuous variables, coordinate geometry, and calculus. We now can talk about motion precisely. This achievement gives us the words to say such sentences as, "When the car struck the tree it was going 50 km/hour." Now every child can understand this sentence and know what is meant by it.In each of these cases there was an advance in human intelligence, ultimately available to ordinary children, that was precipitated by an advance in mathematics, the precise means of expression. Such advances are preceded by a long history of informal development of practical technique. We are now in the midst of an intellectual revolution that promises to have as much impact on human culture as the cases I have just described.We have been programming universal computers for about 50 years. The practice of computation arose from military, scientific, business, and accounting applications. Just as the early Egyptian surveyors probably thought of themselves as experts in the development and application of surveying instruments, so have we developed a priestly cult of "computer scientists." But, as I have pointed out (H. Abelson, G.J. Sussman, and J. Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1996):Computer Science is not a science, and its ultimate significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology-the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Traditional mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."Computation provides us with new tools to express ourselves. This has already had an impact on the way we teach other engineering subjects. For example, one often hears a student or teacher complain that the student knows the "theory" of the material but cannot effectively solve problems. We should not be surprised: the student has no formal way to learn technique. We expect the student to learn to solve problems by an inefficient process: the student watches the teacher solve a few problems, hoping to abstract the general procedures from the teacher's behavior with particular examples. The student is never given any instructions on how to abstract from examples, nor is the student given any language for expressing what has been learned. It is hard to learn what one cannot express.
